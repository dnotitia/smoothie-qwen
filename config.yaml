# Model Configuration
model:
  name: "Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct"   # Target model to modify
  output_path: "./output"      # Path to save the modified model
  dtype: "bfloat16"            # Data type for model weights (e.g. "bfloat16")

# Analysis Configuration
analysis:
  method: "ngram"           # Token analysis method (e.g., "ngram")
  window_size: 4            # Size of the n-gram window (e.g. 2 for bigrams)
  sample_size: 100         # Number of samples per token for analysis

# Weight Smoothing Configuration
adjustment:
  min_scale: 0.5            # Minimum scaling factor for target token weights (0.0â€“1.0)
  smoothness: 10.0          # Smoothing intensity (>1). Higher = more aggressive down-weighting
